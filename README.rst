Extension on th PYTIM package (https://github.com/Marcello-Sega/pytim).
Determining network structure of liquid HF and similar liquids by identification of linear chains, linear segments of a branched structure and cycles.
The number of monomers, terminal molecules of chains, and branching point and the number of bonds per molecule are determined.
Connectivity is defined by a geometric cutoff criterion.

The code is organized such that it mimics the structure of a PYTIM Observable.
